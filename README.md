# HabitationHotSpot.com 

## Description

Our first major project, building a website from scratch that utilizes information from 2 seperate APIs and allows for user input. 

The concept for HabitationHotSpot allows an individual to see what local attractions and amenities are around any given location in the US. This search tool will allow the user to select what local attractions they would like to search for, while also allowing the user to search within a radius of their choosing (given the paramaters of the slider tool). Results will populate in both a visual map, and a list of the local ameneties given the parameters the user enters.

Our first major project provided an excellent hands-on experience that allowed each of us to explore the realms of HTML, CSS, and javascript, and how each plays a vital role in the website functionality. We also got first hand experience with linking several APIs to our webpage and the specifics of how to enable each one. Further, we linked our github pages to the actual domain name by correlating the IP addresses and sending our code into a live website! Visit hahitationhotspot to try it out
